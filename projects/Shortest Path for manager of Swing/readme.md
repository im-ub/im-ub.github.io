## Project Description
Shortest Path Problem is an important issue in Industrial Engineering. Many algorithms have been developed such as Dijkstra, Bellman-ford Algorithm. We want to optimize the algorithm operating time to solve the shortest path problem. 
We would like to compare the performance of Dijkstra and Bellman-ford Algorithm to solve the Shortest Path Problem. Before finding the shortest path using Dijkstra and Bellman-ford algorithm, we want to sort the 'priority list of Swing station vertices'.
