# Shortest Path for manager of Swing
## Project Details
Type: Undergrad Major, team project <br />
Course Name: Data Structure & Algorithm  <br />
Date : 03-10-2021 ~ 06-10-2021  <br />

## Project Description
Shortest Path Problem is an important issue in Industrial Engineering. Many algorithms have been developed such as Dijkstra, Bellman-ford Algorithm. The goal of the project is optimizing the algorithm operating time to solve the shortest path problem. <br />
We compared the performance of Dijkstra and Bellman-ford Algorithm to solve the Shortest Path Problem. Before finding the shortest path using Dijkstra and Bellman-ford algorithm, we sorted the 'priority list of Swing station vertices'. Finally, we compared the performance of Dijkstra and Bellman-ford algorithms according to each sorting algorithms.
